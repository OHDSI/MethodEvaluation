Description: Resources for the evaluation of the
	performance of methods that aim to estimate the magnitude (relative risk) of
	the effect of a drug on an outcome. These resources include reference sets for
	evaluating methods on real data, as well as functions for inserting simulated
	effects in real data based on negative control drug-outcome pairs. Further
	included are functions for the computation of the minimum detectable relative
	risks and functions for computing performance statistics such as predictive
	accuracy, error and bias.
