#' @param minOutcomeCountForModel         Minimum number of outcome events required to build a model.
#' @param minOutcomeCountForInjection     Minimum number of outcome events required to inject a signal.

#' @param prior                           The prior used to fit the outcome model. See

#' @param control                         The control object used to control the cross-validation used
#'                                        to determine the hyperparameters of the prior (if
#'                                        applicable). See \code{\link[Cyclops]{createControl}} for
#'                                        details.
#' @param precision                       The allowed ratio between target and injected signal size.
#' @param firstExposureOnly               Should signals be injected only for the first exposure? (ie.
#'                                        assuming an acute effect)
#' @param washoutPeriod                   Number of days at the start of observation for which no
#'                                        signals will be injected, but will be used to determine
#'                                        whether exposure or outcome is the first one, and for
#'                                        extracting covariates to build the outcome model.
#' @param riskWindowStart                 The start of the risk window relative to the start of the
#'                                        exposure (in days). When 0, risk is assumed to start on the

#' @param riskWindowEnd                   The end of the risk window relative to the start of the
#'                                        exposure. Note that typically the length of exposure is added
#'                                        to this number (when the \code{addExposureDaysToEnd}
#'                                        parameter is set to TRUE).
#' @param addExposureDaysToEnd            Should length of exposure be added to the risk window?
#' @param addIntentToTreat                If true, the signal will not only be injected in the primary
#'                                        time at risk, but also after the time at risk (up until the
#'                                        obseration period end). In both time periods, the target
#'                                        effect size will be enforced. This allows the same positive
#'                                        control synthesis to be used in both on treatment and
#'                                        intent-to-treat analysis variants. However, this will
#'                                        preclude the controls to be used in self-controlled designs
#'                                        that consider the time after exposure. Requires
#'                                        \code{firstExposureOnly = TRUE}.
#' @param firstOutcomeOnly                Should only the first outcome per person be considered when
#'                                        modeling the outcome?
#' @param removePeopleWithPriorOutcomes   Remove people with prior outcomes?
#' @param maxSubjectsForModel             Maximum number of people used to fit an outcome model.
#' @param effectSizes                     A numeric vector of effect sizes that should be inserted.
#' @param outputDatabaseSchema            The name of the database schema that is the location of the
#'                                        tables containing the new outcomesRequires write permissions
#'                                        to this database.

#'                                        "5".
#' @param modelThreads                    Number of parallel threads to use when fitting outcome
#'                                        models.
#' @param generationThreads               Number of parallel threads to use when generating outcomes.
